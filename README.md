# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project is representing the Hungarian flag, as I've recently did a research about this country and discovered how much of a beautiful country it is. It's also one of my dream countries to visit, so I thought why not paint an image of the flag.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - 2 things of the project I am proud of is how the painter quickly but surely paints the flag and how the colors look outstanding, as well the flag is easily noticable.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I would imrpove or do differently about my project is probably, make it a bit smaller since it's just a flag it wouldn't need to be bigger. I was also working on a different image, but it had tobe changed because I wasn't really understanding the code as much so I decided to do something much simpler.
